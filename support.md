## Frequently asked Questions:
### Why is the video not refreshing or appearing choppy?
Live video feeds can be delayed for several reasons. This includes bandwith limitations imposed by your cell phone provider, poor signal, and delayed video coming from the feed due to upload issues. Check the number of bars for your mobile connection. Spoeak with your mobile provider regarding coverage or data throttling issues.

### The video is frozen or I have an error message in the center of the video, how do I fix this?
The app will report when you lose connection and attempt to reconnection for 2 minutes. You can tap the screen at any time to attempt to force refresh the video feeds.

If the video feeds are down and the application indicates it cannot connect, try again later as there may be a disprution in the video feed.
