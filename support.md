## Frequently asked Questions:

### Why do I have to pay for an app that shows free video streams?
We put a lot of time into providing a better experience to view the video feeds. It took many of learning, coding, testing, debugging to build this product. You can always view the feeds free at https://www.prospertx.gov/live-railroad-cameras/.

Check out [this article](https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-create-an-app) for what is costs to build an iOS app. We will have continued maintenance costs to keep this application running even without major enhancements. Each new iOS version requires testing. Apple releases new hardware often that also adds significant expense to maintaining an application.

> Giving a rough answer to how much it costs to create an app (we take the rate of $50 an hour as average): a basic application will cost around $25,000. Medium complexity apps will cost between $40,000 and $70,000. The cost of complex apps usually goes beyond $70,000.

Note that Apple takes 30% of the licensing fee. The license you purchase includes family sharing from Apple, so if you have this configured up to 6 family members can use the app.

We feel you will find the convenience of this application well worth the cost, so we are up front and provide the link to the free website based feeds from the Town of Prosper.

This appication is not affiliated with the Town of Prosper. Note that the Town of Prosper can choose to remove access to the video feeds without warning as indicated in the app terms (found on Prosper Railroad Cams app store page). This is out of the control of Motivated Software, LLC.

### Why is the video not refreshing or appearing choppy?
Live video feeds can be delayed for several reasons. This includes bandwith limitations imposed by your cell phone provider, poor signal, and delayed video coming from the feed due to upload issues. Check the number of bars for your mobile connection. Spoeak with your mobile provider regarding coverage or data throttling issues.

### The video is frozen or I have an error message in the center of the video, how do I fix this?
The app will report when you lose connection and attempt to reconnection for 2 minutes. You can tap the screen at any time to attempt to force refresh the video feeds.

If the video feeds are down and the application indicates it cannot connect, try again later as there may be a disprution in the video feed.

### The app is crashing, how do I resolve this?
The application has gone through extensive testing. You may have a hardware or software issue with your iPhone. Please contact Apple to help you troubleshoot device issues. Motivated Software, LLC will not be able to help you with device issues not related to this software.
